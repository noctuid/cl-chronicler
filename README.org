* About
=chronicler= is a command line utility for tracking statistics about org files, such as word counts. It is primarily meant to be used with a text editor as a front end (see the corresponding [[https://github.com/noctuid/chronicler.el/blob/master/chronicler.el][emacs plugin]]). It is in a very early stage and may be buggy but is functioning for me.
* Installation
** Arch
I will add put this in the AUR eventually. For now, =chronicler= is not package for anything.
** Manual
The only dependency that needs to be installed beforehand is [[https://github.com/snmsts/roswell][roswell]] (and make).

One can then clone the repo, cd into it, and run the following:
#+begin_src
$ make
# make install
#+end_src
